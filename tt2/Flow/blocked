preprocessing: blocked on capturing STDIO. There is a
recipe. Why not use it?

Why can't I recognize... because the module must be
properly registered appending infromation to the
modules installed lists.


$ pwd
~/build


perl -M

Recursively preprocess files, transforming
for example, grammar.in into grammar.out.

Preprocessing routines are expected to 
generate _files_ that [% INSERT %] directives
will pull into the text of grammar.in
to generate grammar.out.



A single script


use Template::Toolkit::Preprocess::Files;

Process Template::Toolkit directives in files with extension
'.in' (for example) to produce files with extension '.out'

Use the subroutine &grammar_builder
to generate files to include in Grammar.cmx .

preprocess Grammar.cmx.

my %special { Grammar => &grammar_builder,}

preprocess qw( ~/build .cmx .cmd), \%special)'

sub grammar_builder { ..... };



# preprocess all files in all directories below the root
# directory, transforming extension source code in
 .cmx  
# to target in .cmd





q(.a) => q(.b),
