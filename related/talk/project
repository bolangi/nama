what is the difference between project and project?

a project is currently a pair of directories in .ecmd and $wav_dir

a project contains the current state of the
	- the saved state as files in project_dir
	- working files, if any from a previous run
	- runs, take1.run

Project->new( name => paul_brocante )
Project->load( name => paul_brocante )



a performance is all actions (update effects) during
an engine run. what other actions might we want to record?

If I recorded the run of subroutines and their parameters,
it might be possible to reproduce operations such as 
adding tracks. Of course, that is the scripting language!


A project




the upshot of this is that i can rename project to project
via pie afer checking if increment take fixes the latest
thing.





if i am willing to eval code, i can save the contents of 
oid to storage. 
#!/usr/bin/env perl
#use Test::More qw(no_plan);
use lib qw(.. .); 
use UI;
$UI::wav_dir = '/media/projects';
$UI::project_name = 'paul_brocante';
=comment
my $s = UI::Project->new(name => 'paul_brocante');
is(defined $s, 1, "Project instantiation" ); 
is( $s->isa('UI::Project'),1, "Parent class for ". ref $s);
is( $s->project_dir , '/media/projects/.ecmd/paul_brocante', "Directory shows");
=cut
my $wav = UI::Wav->new( n => 5, head => 'sax');
print "n: ", $wav->n;
print join $/, %{ $wav->targets} or die;
print join $/, @{ $wav->versions} or die;
print join ".".$/, %{ UI::Wav::targets("sax")} or die;
#is(defined $wav, 1, "Project instantiation" ); 
#is( $wav->isa('UI::Wav'),1, "Parent class for ". ref $s);
#diag( print join $/, %{ $wav->targets });



__END__
