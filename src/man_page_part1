=head1 NAME

B<Nama> - Ecasound-based recorder, mixer and mastering system

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<nama> [I<options>] [I<project_name>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Nama> is a text-based application for multitrack
recording, mixing and mastering using the Ecasound
audio engine developed by Kai Vehmanen.
 
Features include tracks, buses, effects, presets,
sends, inserts, marks and regions. Nama runs under JACK and
ALSA audio frameworks, automatically detects LADSPA plugins,
and supports Ladish Level 1 session handling.

All editing under Nama is non-destructive. Effects are
generally applied in realtime. A track caching (track
freezing) function is also available.

The command prompt accepts Nama commands, Ecasound
interactive-mode commands, shell commands and perl code,
providing command history and autocompletion.  The help
system covers internal commands and LADSPA effects and
includes keyword search.

By default, Nama displays a simple graphic interface while
the command processor runs in a terminal window. The B<-t>
option provides a text-only interface for console users.

=head1 CONTROLLING NAMA/ECASOUND

The Ecasound audio engine is configured through use of
I<chain setups> that specify the signal processing network.
After lauching the engine, realtime control capabilities are
available, for example to adjust signal volume and to set playback
position.

Nama serves as an intermediary, taking high-level commands
from the user, generating appropriate chain setups for
recording, playback, mixing, etc. and running the audio
engine.

=head2 STATIC COMMANDS

Static commands affect I<future> runs of the audio
engine. For example, B<rec, mon> and B<off>
determine whether the current track will get its audio
stream from a live source or whether an existing WAV file
will be played back. Nama responds to static commands by
automatically reconfiguring the engine and displaying the
updated track status.

=head2 DYNAMIC COMMANDS

Once a chain setup is loaded and the engine is launched,
another set of commands controls the realtime behavior of
the audio processing engine. Commonly used I<dynamic
commands> include transport C<start> and C<stop>, 
playback repositioning commands such C<forward>, C<rewind> and
C<setpos>. Effects may be added, modified or removed 
while the engine is running.

=head2 CONFIGURATION

General configuration of sound devices and program options
is performed by editing the F<.namarc> file. On Nama's first
run, a default version of F<.namarc> is usually placed in
the user's home directory. 

=head1 Tk GRAPHICAL UI 

Invoked by default if Tk is installed, this interface
provides a subset of Nama's functionality on two
windows, one for general control, the second for effects. 

The B<main window> has buttons for project create, load
and save, for adding tracks and effects, and for setting
the vol, pan and record status of each track.

The GUI project name bar and time display change color to indicate
whether the upcoming operation will include live recording
(red), mixdown only (yellow) or playback only (green).  Live
recording and mixdown can take place simultaneously.

The B<effects window> provides sliders for each effect
parameters. Parameter range, defaults, and log/linear
scaling hints are automatically detected. Text-entry widgets
are used to enter parameters values for plugins without
hinted ranges.

The command prompt appears in the terminal window
during GUI operation. Text commands may be issued at any
time.

=head1 TEXT UI

Press the I<Enter> key if necessary to get the 
command prompt, which will look something like this:

=over 12

C<nama [sax] ('h' for help)E<gt>>

=back

In this instance, 'sax' is the current track.

When using sub-buses, the bus is indicated before
the track:

=over 12

C<nama [Strings/violin] ('h' for help)E<gt>>

=back

At the prompt, you can enter Nama and Ecasound commands, Perl code
preceded by C<eval> or shell code preceded by C<!>.

Multiple commands on a single line are allowed if delimited
by semicolons. Usually the lines are split on semicolons and
the parts are executed sequentially, however if the line
begins with C<eval> or C<!> the entire line (up to double
semicolons ';;' if present) will be given to the
corresponding interpreter.

You can access command history using up-arrow/down-arrow.

Type C<help> for general help, C<help command> for help with
C<command>, C<help foo> for help with commands containing
the string C<foo>. C<help_effect foo bar> lists all 
plugins/presets/controller containing both I<foo> and
I<bar>. Tab-completion is provided for Nama commands, Ecasound-iam
commands, plugin/preset/controller names, and project names.

Many effects have abbreviations, such as 'afx' for
'add_effect'. 

=head1 TRACKS

Each track has a descriptive name (i.e. vocal) and an
integer track-number assigned when the track is created.
New user tracks initially belong to the Main bus.

Track output signals are usually mixed and pass through the
Master track on the way to soundcard for monitoring.

The following sections describes track attributes and
their effects.

=head2 WIDTH

Specifying 'mono' means the track has one input channel, which
will be recorded as a mono WAV file. Mono track signals are
automatically duplicated to stereo and a pan effect is provided.

Specifying 'stereo' for a track means that two channels of
audio input will be recorded as an interleaved stereo WAV file.

Specifying N channels for a track ('set width N') means
N successive input channels will be recorded as an N-channel 
interleaved WAV file.

=head2 REC/MON/OFF

Track REC/MON/OFF status guides audio processing.

Each track, including Master and Mixdown, has its own
REC/MON/OFF setting and displays its own REC/MON/OFF status.
Each bus also has REC, MON and OFF settings that
influence the behavior of user tracks.

=head3 Track status

As the name suggests, I<REC> status indicates that a track
is ready to record a WAV file. 

I<MON> status indicates an audio stream is available from
disk. This status requires the presence of a file matching
the bus or track version number, if specified. A track set
to REC with no live input will default to MON status.

I<OFF> status means that no audio is available for the track
from any source. A track with no recorded WAV files 
will show OFF status, even if set to MON.

=head3 Bus setting

We describe the effect of Main bus REC/MON/OFF settings on
member tracks. (Sub-bus settings have similar effects on their
tracks.)

The Main bus REC setting does not limit user track status in
any way.

The Main bus MON setting disables recording for member tracks.
Track REC status is forced to MON if a WAV file
is available, or OFF if no WAV file is available.

The Main bus OFF setting forces all user tracks to OFF
status, causing them to be excluded from the chain setup.
I<Note: This setting is distinct from the action of the
C<mute> command, which sets the volume of the track to
zero.>

The Main bus MON mode triggers automatically after a successful
recording run.

The B<mixplay> command sets the Mixdown track to MON and the
Main bus to OFF.

=head2 VERSION NUMBER

Multiple WAV files can be recorded for each track. These are
distinguished by a version number that increments with each
recording run, i.e. F<sax_1.wav>, F<sax_2.wav>, etc.  All
WAV files recorded in the same run have the same version
numbers. 

The version numbers of files for playback can be selected at
the bus or track level. By setting the bus version
to 5, you can play back version 5 of several tracks
at once. Version 5 could signify the fifth take of a song, or
the fifth song of a live recording session. 

The track version setting, if present, overrides the bus
setting. Setting the track version to zero restores control
of the version number to the bus setting.

The Main bus version setting does I<not> currently propagate to
sub-buses. If you have sub-buses you must set bus version 
numbers for each separately if desired.

=head2 MARKS

Marks in Nama are similar to those in other audio editing
software, with one small caveat: Mark positions are relative
to the beginning of an Ecasound chain setup. If your project
involves a single track, and you will be shortening the
stream by setting a region to play, set any marks you need
I<after> defining the region.

=head2 REGIONS

The C<region> command allows you to define endpoints
for a portion of an audio file. Use the C<shift> command
to specify a delay for starting playback.

Only one region may be specified per track. To work around
this limitation, use the C<new_region> command to clone a
track, specifying a new region definition. You can then
independently control volume and pan of this new region,
apply effects, etc.

The C<link_track> command can clone tracks from other
Nama projects. 

=head2 EFFECTS

Each track gets volume and pan effects by default.  New
effects added using C<add_effect> are applied after pan 
volume controls.  You can position effects anywhere you choose
using C<insert_effect>.

=head3 FADERS

Nama allows you to place fades on any track. Fades are
logarithmic, defined by a mark position and a duration.  An
initial volume operator, -eadb, is additionally applied to
tracks as necessary to enable this function.

=head3 SENDS AND INSERTS

The C<send> command can route a track's post-fader output
to a soundcard channel or JACK client in addition to the
normal mixer input. Nama currently allows one aux send per
track.

The C<add_insert> command configures a pre- or post-fader
send-and-return to soundcard channels or JACK clients.
Wet and dry signal paths are provided, with a default
setting of 100% wet.

Each track can have one pre-fader and one post-fader insert.

=head2 BUNCHES

A bunch is just a list of track names. Bunch names are used
with the keyword C<for> to apply one or more commands to to several
tracks at once. A bunch can be created with the C<new_bunch>
command. Any bus name can also be treated as a bunch.
Finally, a number of special bunch keywords are available.

=over 12

=item B<rec>, B<mon>, B<off>

All tracks with the corresponding I<setting> in the current bus

=item B<REC>, B<MON>, B<OFF>

All tracks with the corresponding I<status> in the current bus

=back

=head2 BUSES

=head3 SUB BUSES

B<Sub buses> enable multiple tracks to be routed through a
single mix track before feeding the main mixer bus (or
possibly another sub bus.) 

The following commands create a sub bus and assign
three tracks to it. The mix track takes the name of
the bus and is stereo by default.

	# create a bus named Strings feeding a mix track named Strings
	add_sub_bus Strings 

	# create tracks for the sub-bus
	add_tracks violin cello bass

	# move the tracks from the Main bus (default) to the Strings bus
	for violin cello bass; set bus Strings

	# use the mix track to control bus output volume
	Strings vol - 10

=head3 SEND BUSES

B<Send buses> can be used as instrument monitors,
or to send pre- or post-fader signals from multiple
user tracks to an external program such as jconverter

=head1 ROUTING

=head2 General notes

While Nama can address tracks by either a name and a number,
the chain setups use the track number exclusively.

The Master track (mixer output control) is always
chain 1, the Mixdown track is always chain 2.

Nama uses Ecasound loop devices where necessary to connect
two tracks, or to allow one track to have multiple inputs or
outputs. Each loop device adds one buffer, which increases
latency.

=head2 Flow diagrams

Let's examine the signal flow from track 3, the first 
available user track. Assume track 3 is named "sax".

We will divide the signal flow into track and mixer
sections.  Parentheses show the track number/name.

The stereo outputs of each user track terminate at 
Master_in, a loop device at the mixer input.

=head3 Track, REC status

    Sound device   --+---(3)----> Master_in
      /JACK client   |
                     +---(R3)---> sax_1.wav

REC status indicates that the source of the signal is the
soundcard or JACK client. The input signal will be written
directly to a file except in the special preview and doodle
modes, or if C<rec_disable> is issued.

=head3 Track, MON status

    sax_1.wav ------(3)----> Master_in

=head3 Mixer, with mixdown enabled

In the second part of the flow graph, the mixed signal is
delivered to an output device through the Master chain,
which can host effects. Usually the Master track
provides final control before audio output or mixdown.

    Master_in --(1)--> Master_out --+--------> Sound device
                                    |
                                    +-->(2)--> Mixdown_1.wav

=head3 Mastering Mode

In mastering mode (invoked by C<master_on> and released
C<master_off>) the following network, receives the Master
track signal as input and provides an output to the
soundcard or WAV file.

                          +-(Low)-+ 
                          |       |
    Eq-in -(Eq)-> Eq_out -+-(Mid)-+- Boost_in -(Boost)-> soundcard/wav_out
                          |       |
                          +-(High)+ 

The B<Eq> track hosts an equalizer.

The B<Low>, B<Mid> and B<High> tracks each apply a bandpass
filter, a compressor and a spatialiser.

The B<Boost> track applies gain and a limiter.

These effects and their default parameters are defined
in the configuration file F<.namarc>.

=head2 Mixdown

The C<mixdown> command configures Nama for mixdown. 
The Mixdown track is set to REC (equivalent to C<Mixdown rec>) and the audio
monitoring output is turned off (equivalent to C<main_off>).

Mixdown proceeds after you start the transport.

=head2 Preview and Doodle Modes

These non-recording modes, invoked by C<preview> and C<doodle> commands
tweak the routing rules for special purposes.  B<Preview
mode> disables recording of WAV files to disk.  B<Doodle
mode> disables MON inputs while enabling only one REC track per
signal source. The C<arm> command releases both preview
and doodle modes.

=head2 Autosave

The B<save> command is the usual way to save your work.
Most settings are saved in the file F<State.yml> in the
current project directory.

When you type B<quit> Nama will automatically save your 
work to F<State.yml>. This will overwrite previous settings
in F<State.yml>. If you I<don't> want this behavior, use
Ctrl-C to exit Nama.

If you load a new project and there are unsaved 
changes, Nama will automatically save settings
in a file tagged with the current date and time,
for example, F<State-autosave-2010.09.20-15:32:05>.

By specifying some number of minutes for the
B<autosave_interval> configuration variable in your .namarc
file, Nama will save your settings periodically. However,
Nama will not save settings while the engine is running.

To avoid creating duplicate files, the new settings file
will be created only if it differs from the previous file.

=head2 Jack ports list file

Use I<source ports> or I<source filename.ports> to ask Nama
to connect multiple JACK ports listed in a file
(F<trackname.ports> or F<filename.ports>) to the input
ports for that track, which will be set to
I<ecasound:trackname_in_1> for mono. A stereo track will
use I<ecasound:trackname_in_2> as well.

If the track is stereo, ports from the list are alternately
connected to left and right channels. Larger numbers
of channels are handled similarly.

=head2 Track edits

An edit is an audio clip corresponding to a particular track
and version. The edit replaces part of the original WAV
file, allowing you to fix wrong notes, or substitute one
phrase for another.

Each track can host multiple edits. Edits are
non-destructive; they are achieved by using Ecasound's
ability to fade and sequence WAV files.

Type I<new_edit mark1 mark2> to set up recording an edit for
the current track and version.

When you start the engine, playback will begin
at the current position. The host track will be
faded out between mark1 and mark2, and the
edit track will record from the source specified
for the host track.

Alternatively, type I<setup_edit>. Playback will
start at the current position. Hit the B<P> key
three times to designate the playback start,
punch-in and punch-out positions.

Edits may not overlap, however you may edit the
edit track(s).

I<merge_edits> will recursively merge all edits applied to
the current track and version, creating a new version.

I<preview_edit> will play the edit segment
with the marked content removed.

The I<start_edit> command (or SPACE key if enabled) will
trigger recording the edit. Each I<start_edit> command
will record an additional version on the edit track.
I<redo_edit> will delete the most recent version
and begin recording anew.

The I<restore_edits> command acts on a merged
version, setting the prior unmerged version
with all edits available.

I<list_edits> will label the edits by index
and time. I<next_edit> will play back the
edits one at a time. The most recently
played edit becomes the current edit.

I<delete_edit> will remove the current
edit.
