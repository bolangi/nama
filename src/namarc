#         Nama Configuration file

#         Notes

#         - This configuration file is distinct from
#           Ecasound's configuration file .ecasoundrc . 
#           In most instances the latter is not required.

#        - The format of this file is YAML, preprocessed to allow
#           comments.
#
#        - A value _must_ be supplied for each 'leaf' field.
#          For example "mixer_out_format: cd-stereo"
#
#        - A value must _not_ be supplied for nodes, i.e.
#          'device:'. The value for 'device' is the entire indented
#          data structure that follows in subsequent lines.
#
#        - Indents are significant. Two spaces indent is
#          required for each sublevel.
#
#        - Use the tilde symbol '~' to represent a null value
#          For example "execute_on_project_load: ~"

# project root directory

# all project directories (or their symlinks) will live here

project_root: ~                  # replaced during first run

# Julien Claassen's Notes on Mastering effect defaults
# 
# Eq: All sections are initially off. You can turn them 
# on as needed, one at a time. 
# 
# Bandpass: Default settings are courtesy of Fons
# Adriaensen, who says they will be within 1.5dB of
# flat settings. 
# 
# Compressor is turned off, with reasonable default values 
# set. 
# 
# Spatialiser and limiter: both initially off so you can start out
# clean and slowly work your way from there.
