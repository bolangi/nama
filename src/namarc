#
#         Notes

#        - The format of this file is YAML, preprocessed to allow
#           comments.
#
#        - A value _must_ be supplied for each 'leaf' field.
#          For example "mixer_out_format: cd-stereo"
#
#        - A value must _not_ be supplied for nodes, i.e.
#          'device:'. The value for 'device' is the entire indented
#          data structure that follows in subsequent lines.
#
#        - white space *is* significant. Two spaces indent is
#          required for each sublevel.
#
#        - You may use the tilde symbol '~' to represent a null (undef) value
#          For example "execute_on_project_load: ~"
#
#         - This file is distinct from .ecasoundrc (which in
#           general you will not need to run Nama.)

#### Julien Claassen's Notes on Mastering effect defaults
# 
# Eq: All sections are initially off. You can turn them 
# on as needed, one at a time. 
# 
# Bandpass: Default settings are courtesy of Fons
# Adriaensen, who says they will be within 1.5dB of
# flat settings. 
# 
# Compressor is turned off, with reasonable default values 
# set. 
# 
# Spatialiser and limiter: both initially off so you can start out
# clean and slowly work your way from there.
