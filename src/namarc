#         Notes

#         - This configuration file is distinct from
#           Ecasound's configuration file .ecasoundrc . 
#           In most instances the latter is not required.

#        - The format of this file is YAMLish, preprocessed to allow
#           comments.
#
#        - A value _must_ be supplied for each 'leaf' field.
#          For example "mixer_out_format: cd-stereo"
#
#        - A value must _not_ be supplied for nodes, i.e.
#          'device:'. The value for 'device' is the entire indented
#          data structure that follows in subsequent lines.
#
#        - Indents are significant, two spaces indent for
#          each new level of branching
#
#        - Use the tilde symbol '~' to represent a null value

# Julien Claassen's Notes on Mastering effect defaults
# 
# The eq: All sections turned off, in case you don't want the
# EQ after all and when you turn them on, you can easily do
# them one at a time. 
# 
# All bands set to minimum width, so you can hear center
# you're going to manipulate clearly. You can always extend.
# But that way - I've discovered - it's more accurate to work.
# The band frequencies are just a basic selection, based on my
# usual starting points.
# 
# The compressor's turned off, but some default values are set for all other 
# params.
# 
# The spatialiser is set to 0: no effect. Same goes for the
# limiter. So you can start out clean and slowly work your way
# from there.
