#         Nama Configuration file

#         Notes

#         - This configuration file is distinct from
#           Ecasound's configuration file .ecasoundrc . 
#           In most instances the latter is not required.

#        - The format of this file is YAMLish, preprocessed to allow
#           comments.
#
#        - A value _must_ be supplied for each 'leaf' field.
#          For example "mixer_out_format: cd-stereo"
#
#        - A value must _not_ be supplied for nodes, i.e.
#          'device:'. The value for 'device' is the entire indented
#          data structure that follows in subsequent lines.
#
#        - Indents are significant, two spaces indent for
#          each new level of branching
#
#        - Use the tilde symbol '~' to represent a null value
#
