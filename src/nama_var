#### Top-level module

Globals.p       Module for exporting Nama globals, merges 
                contents of several of the following:

#### Nama variables are declared in one of the following files

pronouns.pl     Pronouns (e.g. $this_track) and 
                indices (e.g. %tn, get track by name)

serialize.pl    Marshalling variables for serializing/deserializing

singletons.pl   Simple hashes (such as $config) or 
				objects such as $file. Hash access to
				underlying fields is expected, and 
				is necessary for Tk slider widgets.

#### Config variables require an entry in config_map

config_map      Maps keys in .namarc (e.g. $mix_to_disk_format)
                to Nama internal variable $config->{mix_to_disk_format}

#### Hash keys of all variables in ./singletons.pl 
#### must be declared in singleton_keys or in config_map
#### This is checked during build

singleton_keys  List of allowed singleton hash keys

#### Lists of variables used for serializing

var_lists.pl    Initializes variable lists for serializing/deserializing
