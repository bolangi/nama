=head1 Nama Variables

Variables are listed in multiple files in the source.

=head2 Exported

L<Audio::Nama::Globals> exports Nama globals, 
which it gets by merging the contents
of the following files:

=over

=item F<pronouns.pl>

Pronouns (e.g. C<$this_track>) and 
indices (e.g. C<%tn>, get track by name)

=item F<serialize.pl>

Marshalling variables for serializing/deserializing (e.g. C<@tracks_data>)

=item F<singletons.pl> 

Simple hash structures (such as C<$config>) or objects such
as F<$file> that aggregate data.  The hashes can be invested
with object properties as need be.

=head2 Other lists

=over

=item F<config_map>

Maps keys in F<.namarc> (e.g. I<mix_to_disk_format>) to the
corresponding Nama internal scalar (e.g. C<$config-E<gt>{mix_to_disk_format}>

=item F<singleton_keys>

List of allowed singleton hash keys. 

Keys of variables appearing in ./singletons.pl 
should be listed in singleton_keys or in config_map.
Undeclared keys will trigger warnings during build.

=head2 F<var_lists.pl>

Declares lists of variables used in
serializing/deserializing.

=item C<@global_effect_chain_vars>

Mainly user defined and system-wide effect chains,
stored in F<global_effect_chains.json> in the 
Nama project root directory.

=item C<@tracked_vars>

These variables are saved to F<State.json> in the project
directory and placed under version control.

=item C<@persistent_vars>

These Variables saved to F<Aux.json>, I<not> under version control.
including project-specific effect-chain definitions,
and track/version comments.
