track => <<TRACK,
   Most of the Track related commands operate on the 'current
   track'. To cut volume for a track called 'sax',  you enter
   'sax mute' or 'sax; mute'. The first part of the
   command sets a new current track. You can also specify a
   current track by number,  i.e.  '4 mute'.

   add_track, add            -  create one or more new tracks
                                example: add sax; r 3 
                                    (record sax from input 3) 
                                example: add piano; r synth

                                files from an existing track.
