Globals.pm      Module for exporting Nama global variables.
				It is built from the following files: 

var_pronouns    Pronouns (e.g. $this_track) and 
                indices (e.g. %tn, %ti to get track by name, index)

var_serialize   Marshalling variables for saving and restoring project state

var_singletons  Objects and simple hashes that contain
				(such as $config) or 
                objects such as $file. Hash access to
                underlying fields is expected, and 
                is necessary for Tk slider widgets.

                Hash keys of all variables in var_singletons must be
                declared in var_keys or in var_config. This is checked
                during build

var_keys        List of allowed singleton hash keys

#### Config variables require an entry in var_config

var_config      Maps keys in .namarc (e.g. $mix_to_disk_format)
                to Nama internal variable $config->{mix_to_disk_format}

var_map_gen     Script to generate mappings from var_config


#### Lists of variables used for serializing

var_lists       Initializes variable lists for serializing/deserializing
