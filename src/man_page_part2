=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

On any change in setup, the GUI display updates and
C<show_tracks> command is executed automatically showing
what to expect the next time the engine is started.

You can use the C<chains> command to verify the Ecasound
chain setup. (The Ecasound command C<cs-save-as mysetup.ecs>
will additionally store all engine data, effects as
well as routing.)

The C<dump> command displays data for the current track.
The C<dumpall> command shows all state that would be saved.

This is the same output that is written to the F<State.yml>
file when you issue the C<save> command.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

No waveform or signal level displays are provided.  

No latency compensation across signal paths is provided at
present, although this feature is planned.

=head1 SECURITY CONCERNS

If you are using Nama with the NetECI interface (i.e. if
Audio::Ecasound is I<not> installed) you should block TCP
port 2868 if your computer is exposed to the Internet. 

=head1 INSTALLATION

The following commands, available on Unixlike systems with
Perl installed, will pull in Nama and other Perl libraries
required for text mode operation:

C<cpanm Audio::Nama>
-or-
C<PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1 cpan Audio::Nama>

To use the GUI, you will need to install Tk:

C<cpanm Tk>

You may want to install Audio::Ecasound if you prefer not to
run Ecasound in server mode:

C<cpanm Audio::Ecasound>

You can pull the source code as follows: 

C<git clone git://github.com/bolangi/nama.git>

Consult the F<BUILD> file for build instructions.
