Audio/Ecasound/Flow version 0.01
================================

Ecasound Flow assists multitrack recording
by adding high-level functionality to the Ecasound
audio processing engine.

Currently two interfaces are supported: a recorder/mixer GUI
based on the Tk widget set, and a command-line interface for
console users.
