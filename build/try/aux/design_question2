I have a program which processes data, produces
outputs. It seeks to support two operating modes: 

     A Tk GUI event loop
	 
	 A command-line parse and execute loop

Right now my code is sprouting lines like this:

	&refresh_track_display if $gui;

I have concepts like Track and Track_Group,
and templates for converting them into 
the chain configurations used by a sound
engine to mix, route and process audio signals.

Right now all my code (except the GUI widgets part)
is procedural, using hashes and arrays to store data.

I am at about 4k lines of code, pretty clean 
considering. I have put in a lot of work so far,
and now have something that can go a lot further.

It is a fun way to learn some computer science.
