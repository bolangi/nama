=head1 NAME

Nama - Ecasound-based recorder, mixer and mastering system

=head1 ABOUT 

Nama provides a convenient interface for multitrack
recording, effects processing, mixdown, and mastering.
Tracks can have auxiliary sends and inserts.  User-defined
buses allow musicians to have individualized monitors.

Nama is based on Ecasound, a stable, versatile and mature
audio processing engine. Nama gives you everything great
about Ecasound, along with high-level track, bus
and project abstractions expected of a digital audio
workstation.

While Nama is especially suited for console users and
headless applications, it also has Tk-based GUI with
transport buttons, sliders for track and effects parameters,
and other commonly used functions.
 
The command-line interface executes internal commands,
Ecasound commands, perl code, and shell commands. It
includes history, help, and autocompletion.

'Nama' is Japanese for 'live', describing live performances,
raw fish and draft beer.

=head1 INSTALLATION

You can probably install Nama via CPAN using the following
command to pull in all dependencies:

        PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1 cpan Audio::Nama

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

=head2 Perl Modules

Most Perl dependencies are pulled in automatically when
installing via CPAN. The following will install all required
dependencies without prompting.

    PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1 cpan Audio::Nama

=head2 Libraries

The Ecasound audio processing libraries must be installed.
Ecasound may be obtained from
http://ecasound.seul.org/ecasound/ or as precompiled binary
packages for your Un*x distribution.

The LADSPA SDK is required to autosense LADSPA plugins and
scaling hints.  It is available at:

http://www.ladspa.org/ladspa_sdk/download.html  

In particular the utility program 'analyseplugin' must be
installed in a directory in your execution PATH.  

'file', a BSD utility program that detects file formats,
must be installed for Nama to correctly identify stereo
files.

Nama's mastering mode uses a number of LADSPA plugins.
These specified in the configuration file .namarc.
