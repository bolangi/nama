=head1 NAME

Nama - Ecasound-based recorder/mixer

=head1 ABOUT 

Nama is a recorder/mixer application using Ecasound to
perform multitrack recording, effects processing, and
mastering.

Controlled by a command prompt or by an optional GUI, Nama
makes multitrack audio production available to console
users, and in remote or headless applications. 

Nama's features include tracks, buses, effects, presets,
sends, inserts, marks and regions. Nama supports JACK
and ALSA audio routing, and Ladish Level 1 session
handling.

All signal processing under Nama is non-destructive.
Effects are generally applied in realtime, with track
caching (intermediate mixdown) available to conserve CPU.

Nama's command prompt is based on the GNU ReadLine library.
Users can enter Nama commands, Ecasound interactive-mode 
commands, shell commands or perl code.

Nama's optional GUI provides access to basic recording and
effects processing functions. It is based on the Tk widget
set.

"Nama" is Japanese for "live", describing live performances,
raw fish and draft beer.

=head1 INSTALLATION

=head2 Installing Nama and its Perl Dependencies from CPAN

The following command will install Nama, automatically
pulling in all Perl modules required to run Nama in text mode:

		PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1 cpan Audio::Nama

To use the GUI, you will need to install Tk:

		cpan Tk

You may optionally install Audio::Ecasound to run Ecasound
via libecasoundc:

		cpan Audio::Ecasound

If you simply want a tarball to inspect or prod, look 
for a file named Audio-Nama-????.tar.gz in this directory:

		http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/G/GA/GANGLION/

=head2 Installing Nama Using the Debian Package System

		apt-get install libaudio-nama-perl
	
=head2 Build from Source

If you want to inspect or modify Nama's internals,
you can pull the source code as follows: 

		git clone git://github.com/bolangi/nama.git

Consult the F<BUILD> file for build instructions.

=head2 Non-Perl Dependencies

(These dependencies are pulled in automatically if you
install Nama using apt-get in a Debian system.)

The Ecasound audio processing libraries should be installed.
Ecasound should be compiled with support for LADSPA, libsndfile,
libsamplerate and JACK. Ecasound may be obtained from
http://ecasound.seul.org/ecasound/ or as precompiled binary
package for your Un*x distribution.

The LADSPA SDK is required to autosense LADSPA plugins and
scaling hints.  It is available at:

http://www.ladspa.org/ladspa_sdk/download.html  

In particular the utility program 'analyseplugin' must be
installed in a directory in your execution PATH.  

Nama's mastering mode uses a number of LADSPA plugins.
Defaults are specified in the configuration file .namarc.
