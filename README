=head1 NAME

Nama - Ecasound-based recorder/mixer

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Nama> is a application and library for multitrack
recording, mixing and mastering using the Ecasound
audio engine developed by Kai Vehmanen.

The complementary terminal and Tk GUI interfaces provide
discoverable access to a audio engineering environment with
familiar classes for track, bus, effect, preset, send,
insert, mark, region. 

Every possible effort has been made to systematize and
abbreviate the setup process. For this purpose, we provide a
text command set, a simple, powerful command language
interpreter, along with some novel templates and tools. 
Nama now uses git for managing project state, and for
providing checkpointing, branching and undo cababilities.

In the back end, nama builds signal processing graphs for
the engine, manages successive engine configure-run cycles,
and applies fades, effects and edits to the audio streams.

Connections at the terminals of the graph
are made using a library of some 20 different
subclasses of IO objects. 

The chief output target is the Ecasound
chain setup file, a human readable 
specification precisely expressing
the network topology which is used 
to configure the Ecasound engine.

Nama implements realtime control of the engine through ECI,
Ecasound's remote command languge.

This allows live effects control from GUI widgets, MIDI
controllers, text commands (type 'em in pardner!), MIDI
sequencers, or other avenues.

To reduce manual input, Nama offers various templates and
tools for automating project setup including effect chains,
effect profiles, project templates, and track bunches. 

Wavform editing and display is provided by external
applications, such as Audacity or Mhwaveedit.

Nama runs under JACK and ALSA audio frameworks,
automatically detects LADSPA and LV2 plugins, and supports
Ladish Level 1 session handling.

=head1 INSTALLATION

=head2 Installing Nama and its Perl Dependencies from CPAN

The following command will install Nama, automatically
pulling in all Perl modules required to run Nama in text mode:

		PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1 cpan Audio::Nama

To use the GUI, you will need to install Tk:

		cpan Tk

You may optionally install Audio::Ecasound to run Ecasound
via libecasoundc:

		cpan Audio::Ecasound

You can browse the sources or download a tarball via:

		http://search.cpan.org/dist/Audio-Nama

=head2 Installing Nama from your distribution's package manager

=head3 Debian (testing, unstable) 

You can install Nama from Debian by typing:

		apt-get install nama

or

		aptitude nama

To use Nama's GUI, you will also need to install Tk:

		apt-get install perl-tk

=head3 Ubuntu (lucid, maverick)

Use Ubuntu's package Add/Remove tool.

=head3 Arch Linux
	
=head2 Build from Source

If you want to inspect or modify Nama's internals,
you can pull the source code as follows: 

		git clone git://github.com/bolangi/nama.git

Consult the F<BUILD> file for build instructions.

=head2 Non-Perl Dependencies

(These dependencies are pulled in automatically if you
install Nama in a Debian system.)

The Ecasound audio processing libraries should be installed.
Ecasound should be compiled with support for LADSPA, libsndfile,
libsamplerate and JACK. Ecasound may be obtained from
http://ecasound.seul.org/ecasound/ or as precompiled binary
package for your Un*x distribution.

The LADSPA SDK is required to autosense LADSPA plugins and
scaling hints.  It is available at:

http://www.ladspa.org/ladspa_sdk/download.html  

In particular the utility program 'analyseplugin' must be
installed in a directory in your execution PATH.  

Nama's mastering mode uses a number of LADSPA plugins
in a reasonably flat starting configuration.
provided that the user installs the plugins
listed in the default configuration file .namarc.

Git is required to utilize Nama's source control 
and undo features.
