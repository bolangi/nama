=head1 Audio::Ecasound::Multitrack

Audio::Ecasound::Multitrack provides classes for tracks and
buses, a template system for signal routing and other
infrastructure to manage multitrack recording and mixing
using the Ecasound audio processing engine.

The distribution includes Nama, a recorder-mixer
application with command-line and graphic interfaces.

The graphic interface uses the Tk widget set. 

The command-line interface executes internal commands,
Ecasound commands, perl code, and shell commands. It
includes history and help functions. 

'Nama' is Japanese for 'live', describing live performances,
raw fish and draft beer.

=head1 INSTALLATION

   make install

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

=head2 Perl Modules

	Carp
	Cwd
	Storable 
	Getopt::Std
	Tk (for GUI users)
	Event
	Audio::Ecasound
	Parse::RecDescent
	Data::YAML
	File::Find::Rule
	File::Spec::Link
	IO::All
	Term::Readline
	Term::Readline::Gnu
	Time::HiRes
	Text::Template (for building from sources)

=head2 Libraries

The Ecasound audio processing libraries must be
installed. Ecasound may be obtained from
http://ecasound.seul.org/ecasound/ or as precompiled binary
packages for your Un*x distribution.

The LADSPA SDK is required to autosense LADSPA plugins and
scaling hints.  It is available at:

http://www.ladspa.org/ladspa_sdk/download.html  

In particular the utility program 'analyseplugin' must be
installed in a directory in your execution PATH.  

'file', a BSD utility program that detects file formats must
be installed for Nama to correctly identify stereo files.

=head1 BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

You may decide to clone the Nama's github repository and
from source rather than installing from CPAN.  It is much
easier to browse or hack on Nama this way. Functionality is
separated into a number of files, and you will see
C<$::package_var> instead of
C<$Audio::Ecasound::Multitrack::package_var>.

You can get also updates more quickly and can share patches
with other developers.

=head2 Procedure

For typical build and test:

	cd build
	git-clone git://github.com/bolangi/nama.git
	cd nama/src
	./build
    ./ui

To install the module, do as usual:

    cd ..
	perl Makefile.PL
    make && make test && make install
    
=head2 Description 

The F<build> script creates the perl modules for the
distribution under the F<nama/lib> directory using F<*.p>,
F<*.pl>, F<*.t> and other files in the F<nama/src> directory.

F<build> looks into the F<*.p> files for lines that look
like:

    [% somefile.pl %]

This notation is analogous to the C-preprocessor #include
directive: F<somefile.pl> gets included in the source
at that point. Some of these include lines are more complicated:

    [% qx(./strip_comments ./grammar_body) %]

Here the preprocessor runs the script F<strip_comments> on
F<grammar_body>, removing text that would choke the parser
generator.

F<Build> provides a few parameters to the preprocessing
script F<preproc>, which uses the Text::Template to perform
most of the required substitutions.

To see the names of the files and scripts used to build the
modules type:

	ls *.p        
	grep '\[%' *  # shows all include directives
