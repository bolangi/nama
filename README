=head1 NAME

Nama - Ecasound-based recorder, mixer and mastering system

=head1 ABOUT 

Nama is a multitrack recording, effects-processing, mixing
and mastering application based on the Ecasound audio
processing engine. Nama adds track, bus and project
abstractions that supplement Ecasound's proven capabilities.

Nama's features include LADSPA effects hosting, presets, aux
sends, inserts, regions, time-shifting, send buses (for
personalised instrument monitors) and sub buses (for
creating specialised processing networks.) 

Nama's mastering mode adds an equalizer, three-band
compressor and limiter to the signal chain. The
configuration is modelled after JAMin, a respected mastering
application. The default mastering effects can be customised
via .namarc, Nama's configuration file. 

Nama has both a graphical user interface and a 
text interface.

The text interface gives console users an efficient
environment for audio production. The Gnu ReadLine library
is used to provide a shell-like command prompt that can
execute Nama-specific commands, Ecasound interactive-mode
commands, shell commands and Perl code. Tab-completion of
commands, filenames and effect labels saves keystrokes.
Online help allows looking up commands and effects by
category, name, keyword and LADSPA unique ID.

The minimalistic GUI, written in Tk, provides buttons and
sliders to manage projects, tracks, effects, marks,
recording and mixdown. The command prompt remains available
when running Nama in GUI mode.

"Nama" is Japanese for "live", describing live performances,
raw fish and draft beer.

=head2 Installing Nama and its Perl Dependencies from CPAN

The following command will install Nama, automatically
pulling in all Perl modules required to run Nama in text mode:

		PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1 cpan Audio::Nama

To use the GUI, you will need to install Tk:

		cpan Tk

You may optionally install Audio::Ecasound to run Ecasound
via libecasoundc:

		cpan Audio::Ecasound

If you simply want a tarball to inspect or prod, look 
for a file named Audio-Nama-????.tar.gz in this directory:

		http://search.cpan.org/CPAN/authors/id/G/GA/GANGLION/

=head2 Installing Nama Using the Debian Package System

		apt-get install perl perl-modules libio-all-perl libgraph-perl libtext-format-perl libmodern-perl libfile-find-rule-perl libanyevent-perl libevent-perl libyaml-tiny-perl libparse-recdescent-perl libterm-readline-gnu-perl 

2. Install Ecasound

		apt-get install ecasound

3. Install LADSPA utilities and and some LADSPA plugins

		apt-get install ladspa-sdk swh-plugins tap-plugins

4. Download Nama

		wget http://freeshell.de/~bolangi/nama/libaudio-nama-perl_0.9986-1_all.deb

5. Install Nama

		dpkg -i libaudio-nama-perl_0.9986-1_all.deb

=head2 Build from Source

You can pull the source code as follows: 

		git clone git://github.com/bolangi/nama.git

Consult the F<BUILD> file for build instructions.

=head2 Non-Perl Dependencies

The Ecasound audio processing libraries should be installed.
Ecasound should be compiled with support for LADSPA, libsndfile,
libsamplerate and JACK. Ecasound may be obtained from
http://ecasound.seul.org/ecasound/ or as precompiled binary
package for your Un*x distribution.

The LADSPA SDK is required to autosense LADSPA plugins and
scaling hints.  It is available at:

http://www.ladspa.org/ladspa_sdk/download.html  

In particular the utility program 'analyseplugin' must be
installed in a directory in your execution PATH.  

Nama's mastering mode uses a number of LADSPA plugins.
Defaults are specified in the configuration file .namarc.
