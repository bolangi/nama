=head1 NAME

Nama - digital audio workstation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Nama> is a lightweight digital audio workstation based
on Ecasound. It is suitable for multitrack recording, mixing,
effects-processing and other audio processing tasks.

New projects begin with a mixer, and may include tracks,
buses, effects, sends, inserts, marks, regions, fades, edits
and sequences. 

=head2 Command language and help system

Nama provides a command interpreter with help system and
GUI.  Commands have full names and shortcuts (e.g.
"add-effect" and "afx"). Commands may to be iterated over
multiple tracks. 

Nama has the concept of a currently selected object. At any
time, there is usually a current bus, current track and
current effect and current parameter. Track commands will
act on the current track, bus commands on the currently
selected bus, effect commands on the currently selected
effect/parameter.

The help system provides searchable access to documentation
for all Nama commands and shortcuts, and for LADSPA, LV2 and
Ecasound effects.

In addition to executing its own commands, Nama will pass
commands to Ecasound, Midish, the perl interpreter and the
shell. 

=head2 Backend

Nama creates signal processing graphs for the Ecasound
engine; applies fades, effects and edits to the audio
streams; and manages successive configure-run cycles. If
jackd is running, Nama will automatically map soundcard IO
via JACK. 

When a user command requires it, Nama automatically
reconfigures the Ecasound engine. While the engine is
running Nama accepts parameter control inputs from GUI
sliders, hotkeys, text commands, MIDI devices, OSC packets,
and preprogrammed envelopes.

=head2 GUI

Nama's GUI will display if Tk is available.  Nama can spawn
Audacity or MHWaveedit to view/edit selected waveforms. 

=head2 Project management

Project state is serialized as JSON files and the entire
project history is managed by Git. Projects can be branched,
and easily restored to earlier states. 

=head2 Project reuse

Three types of templates are available to reuse project
components: effect chains, effect profiles, and project
templates. An effect chain is a series of effects with
parameters.  An effect profile includes one or more tracks
with their effects and inserts. Nama's mastering network is
stored as an effect profile.

=head1 INSTALLATION

=head2 Installing Nama and its Perl Dependencies from CPAN

The following command will install Nama, automatically
pulling in all Perl modules required to run Nama in text mode:

		cpanm Audio::Nama

However if you don't have cpanm, this should still work:

		PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1 cpan Audio::Nama

To use the GUI, you will need to install Tk:

		cpanm Tk

You may optionally install Audio::Ecasound to run Ecasound
via libecasoundc:

		cpanm Audio::Ecasound

You can browse the sources or download a tarball via:

		http://search.cpan.org/dist/Audio-Nama

=head2 Building from Source

If you want to inspect or modify Nama's internals, or keep
up with new developments, you can pull the source code as
follows: 

		git clone git://github.com/bolangi/nama.git

Consult the F<BUILD> file for build instructions.

=head2 Non-Perl Dependencies

The Ecasound audio processing libraries should be installed.
Ecasound should be compiled with support for LADSPA, libsndfile,
libsamplerate and JACK. Ecasound may be obtained from
http://ecasound.seul.org/ecasound/ or as precompiled binary
package for your Un*x distribution.

The LADSPA SDK is required to autosense LADSPA plugins and
scaling hints.  It is available at:

http://www.ladspa.org/ladspa_sdk/download.html  

In particular the utility program 'analyseplugin' must be
installed in a directory in your execution PATH.  

Nama's mastering mode uses a number of LADSPA plugins
in a reasonably flat starting configuration.
provided that the user installs the plugins
listed in the default configuration file .namarc.

Git is required to utilize Nama's project 
management and  and undo features.
