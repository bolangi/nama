=head1 NAME

Nama - Ecasound-based recorder/mixer

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Nama> is a application and library for multitrack
recording, mixing and mastering using the Ecasound
audio engine developed by Kai Vehmanen.

Nama builds signal processing graphs for Ecasound 
while offering the user familiar concepts of
of track, bus, effect, preset, send, insert, mark 
and region, as well as various templates 
and tools for automating project setup.

Wavform editing and display is provided 
by external applications, such as Audacity or Mhwaveedit.

A simple and convenient GUI is provided,
more powerful capabilities available
at the command prompt. 

Nama runs under JACK and ALSA audio frameworks,
automatically detects LADSPA and LV2 plugins, 
uses Git for project management.
supports Ladish Level 1 session handling.

=head1 INSTALLATION

=head2 Installing Nama and its Perl Dependencies from CPAN

The following command will install Nama, automatically
pulling in all Perl modules required to run Nama in text mode:

		PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1 cpan Audio::Nama

To use the GUI, you will need to install Tk:

		cpan Tk

You may optionally install Audio::Ecasound to run Ecasound
via libecasoundc:

		cpan Audio::Ecasound

You can browse the sources or download a tarball via:

		http://search.cpan.org/dist/Audio-Nama

=head2 Installing Nama from your distribution's package manager

=head3 Debian (testing, unstable) 

You can install Nama from Debian by typing:

		apt-get install nama

or

		aptitude nama

To use Nama's GUI, you will also need to install Tk:

		apt-get install perl-tk

=head3 Ubuntu (lucid, maverick)

Use Ubuntu's package Add/Remove tool.

=head3 Arch Linux
	
=head2 Build from Source

If you want to inspect or modify Nama's internals,
you can pull the source code as follows: 

		git clone git://github.com/bolangi/nama.git

Consult the F<BUILD> file for build instructions.

=head2 Non-Perl Dependencies

(These dependencies are pulled in automatically if you
install Nama in a Debian system.)

The Ecasound audio processing libraries should be installed.
Ecasound should be compiled with support for LADSPA, libsndfile,
libsamplerate and JACK. Ecasound may be obtained from
http://ecasound.seul.org/ecasound/ or as precompiled binary
package for your Un*x distribution.

The LADSPA SDK is required to autosense LADSPA plugins and
scaling hints.  It is available at:

http://www.ladspa.org/ladspa_sdk/download.html  

In particular the utility program 'analyseplugin' must be
installed in a directory in your execution PATH.  

Nama's mastering mode uses a number of LADSPA plugins
in a reasonably flat starting configuration.
provided that the user installs the plugins
listed in the default configuration file .namarc.

Git is required to utilize Nama's source control 
and undo features.
