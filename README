=head1 NAME

Nama - Ecasound-based recorder/mixer

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Nama> is a text-based application for multitrack
recording, mixing and mastering using the Ecasound
audio engine developed by Kai Vehmanen.
 
Features include tracks, buses, effects, presets,
sends, inserts, marks and regions. Nama runs under JACK and
ALSA audio frameworks, automatically detects LADSPA plugins,
and supports Ladish Level 1 session handling.

=head1 INSTALLATION

=head2 Installing Nama and its Perl Dependencies from CPAN

The following command will install Nama, automatically
pulling in all Perl modules required to run Nama in text mode:

		PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT=1 cpan Audio::Nama

To use the GUI, you will need to install Tk:

		cpan Tk

You may optionally install Audio::Ecasound to run Ecasound
via libecasoundc:

		cpan Audio::Ecasound

You can browse the sources or download a tarball via:

		http://search.cpan.org/dist/Audio-Nama

=head2 Debian Install

Soon you should be able to install from Debian by typing:

		apt-get install nama
	
=head2 Build from Source

If you want to inspect or modify Nama's internals,
you can pull the source code as follows: 

		git clone git://github.com/bolangi/nama.git

Consult the F<BUILD> file for build instructions.

=head2 Non-Perl Dependencies

(These dependencies are pulled in automatically if you
install Nama using apt-get in a Debian system.)

The Ecasound audio processing libraries should be installed.
Ecasound should be compiled with support for LADSPA, libsndfile,
libsamplerate and JACK. Ecasound may be obtained from
http://ecasound.seul.org/ecasound/ or as precompiled binary
package for your Un*x distribution.

The LADSPA SDK is required to autosense LADSPA plugins and
scaling hints.  It is available at:

http://www.ladspa.org/ladspa_sdk/download.html  

In particular the utility program 'analyseplugin' must be
installed in a directory in your execution PATH.  

Nama's mastering mode uses a number of LADSPA plugins.
Defaults are specified in the configuration file .namarc.
