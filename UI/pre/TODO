The grammar does not seem to get control of the input lines.
Maybe falling through the conditional.

Once again, move all to P::R? Grammar? Why not?
Then you'll get rid of all the conditionals.

That is your program, anyway, to get rid of conditionals.
TODO, get rid of that thing you so loved, build and tested.

On the Graphical side, I have a typical error, probably
caused by odd or missing number of elements, a kind of
error that I remember spending many ours debugging.

Neither is that daunting, yet I have the urge to plunge
into the unknown, I could make a new branch, spend an hour
in it. But first would come the usage


package Track;
our @ISA;
use Object::Tiny qw(

	targets 
	vol 
	ops 
	active 
	file 
	pan 
	versions 
	ch_r 
	ch_m 
	offset 
	rw
);

=comment

	targets # matches version number to filenemae
			# redirection for backing.wav to 
			# show up as version 1 (usually backing_1.wav) 
	vol     # my volume effect, EFFECT_ID
	pan 	# my pan effect EFFECT_ID
	ops 	# a list of my effects EFFECT_IDs
	active 	# selected WAV file version
	file	# filename root, i.e. vocal in vocal_5.wav
			# the 'name' of the track
	versions# integers representing a wav file 1 -> sax_1.wav
	ch_r    # channel for recording to
	ch_m    # channel for playing back
	offset  # no idea!
	rw 		# whether status is REC MON OR MUTE

I would want to break that down to smaller objects

Wav objects
	
	sax 6 -> sax_6.wav


$state_c{$n}->{offset}

package Wav


my $wav = Wav->new( head => vocal);

$wav->versions;
$wav->head  # vocal
$wav->i     # 3 i.e. track 3

returns numbers

$wav->targets

returns targets

$wav->full_path

new branch called object

first test out that code for set! 







sub set {
	my $self = shift;
	my %new_vals = @_;
	my %filter;
	map{$filter{$_}++} keys %{ $self };
	map{ $self->{$_} = $new_vals{$_} if $filter{$_} } keys %new_vals;
}
	
	


I also need, well, want to fix the @sorted_ladspa problem.
That is related to yaml round tripping. could it be the 
size of the array? Impossible. So look at the code.
