what is the difference between project and session?

a project is currently a pair of directories in .ecmd and $wav_dir

a project contains the current state of the
	- the saved state as files in project_dir
	- working files, if any from a previous run
	- runs, take1.run

Project->new( name => paul_brocante )
Project->load( name => paul_brocante )



a performance is all actions (update effects) during
an engine run. what other actions might we want to record?

If I recorded the run of subroutines and their parameters,
it might be possible to reproduce operations such as 
adding tracks. Of course, that is the scripting language!


A session




the upshot of this is that i can rename session to project
via pie afer checking if increment take fixes the latest
thing.





if i am willing to eval code, i can save the contents of 
oid to storage.
