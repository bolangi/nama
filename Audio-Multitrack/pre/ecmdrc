#         Configuration file for Audio::Multitrack

#         Notes: 

#         - This configuration file is distinct from
#           Ecasound's configuration file .ecasoundrc . 
#           In most instances the latter is not required.

#        - The format of this file is YAMLish, preprocessed to allow
#           comments.
#
#        - Indents are two spaces
#
#        - A value _must_ be supplied for each 'leaf' field
#          such as 'mixer_out_device'
#
#        - A value must _not_ be supplied for nodes, i.e.
#          'device', whose value is to be the entire indented
#          data structure that follows.
#
#        - The special symbol '~' represents a null value
#
#        - Check the 'devices' and 'abbreviations' section at
#          the end of this file to understand the values that
#          appear below. 'consumer' for example, is defined as
#          /dev/dsp.
