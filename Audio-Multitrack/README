=head1 Audio::Ecasound::Multitrack

Audio::Ecasound::Multitrack provides classes for tracks and
buses, a template system for signal routing and other
infrastructure to manage multitrack recording and mixing
using the Ecasound audio processing engine.

The distribution includes Nama, a recorder-mixer
application with command-line and graphic interfaces.

The graphic interface uses the Tk widget set. 

The command-line interface executes internal commands,
Ecasound commands, perl code, and shell commands. It
includes history and help functions. 

'Nama' is Japanese for 'live', describing live performances,
raw fish and draft beer.

=head2 Libraries

The Ecasound audio processing libraries must be
installed. Ecasound may be obtained from
http://ecasound.seul.org/ecasound/ or as precompiled binary
packages for your Un*x distribution.

The LADSPA SDK is required to autosense LADSPA plugins and
scaling hints.  It is available at:

http://www.ladspa.org/ladspa_sdk/download.html  

In particular the utility program 'analyseplugin' must be
installed in a directory in your execution PATH.  

'file', a BSD utility program that detects file formats must
be installed for Nama to correctly identify stereo files.

=head1 BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

It is much easier to browse the sources prior to build. 
Functionality is separated into a number of files,
and the long module prefix "Audio::Ecasound::Multitrack" is
shortened to "::".

*.pm files for the distribution are created from source
files *.p and *.pl and a few other files by executing the
F<./myproc> script.

For typical build and test type the following in the F<pre>
directory.

	./myproc; ./ui

To see the names of the files and scripts used to build the
modules type:

	grep '\[%' *  # finds directives for including files

	ls *.p
