Audio::Multitrack version 0.93
================================

Audio::Multitrack assists multitrack, multibus recording by
adding concepts of track and bus to the Ecasound audio
processing engine. 

The distribution includes Ecmd, a multitrack recording and
mixing application. 

Ecmd's graphic interface is a recorder/mixer with two panels
based on the Tk widget set.  

Ecmd's command-line interface has history, and
help functions.  Ecasound IAM commands pass directly to
the audio-processing engine.
