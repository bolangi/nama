Audio::Multitrack version 0.95
================================

Audio::Multitrack implements concepts of track and bus,
provides user interfaces and other infrastructure 
needed to conveniently use Ecasound for multitrack recording
purposes.

The distribution includes Ecmd, a multitrack recording and
mixing application. 

Ecmd's graphic interface is a recorder/mixer with two panels
based on the Tk widget set. 

Ecmd's command-line interface executes its own commands,
Ecasound commands, perl code, and shell commands. It
includes history and help functions.
