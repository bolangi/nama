Audio::Ecasound::Multitrack version 0.95
========================================

Audio::Ecasound::Multitrack provides classes for tracks and
buses, a template system for signal routing and other
infrastructure to manage multitrack recording and mixing
using the Ecasound audio processing engine.

The distribution includes Nama, a recorder-mixer
application with full featured command-line and
graphic interfaces.

The graphic interface is a recorder/mixer based on
the Tk widget set. 

The command-line interface executes its own commands,
Ecasound commands, perl code, and shell commands. It
includes history and help functions. 

The name 'nama' is Japanese for 'live' and is used to
describe live performances, raw fish, and draft beer.
