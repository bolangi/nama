Audio::Ecasound::Multitrack
===========================

Audio::Ecasound::Multitrack provides classes for tracks and
buses, a template system for signal routing and other
infrastructure to manage multitrack recording and mixing
using the Ecasound audio processing engine.

The distribution includes Nama, a recorder-mixer
application with command-line and graphic interfaces.

The graphic interface uses the Tk widget set. 

The command-line interface executes internal commands,
Ecasound commands, perl code, and shell commands. It
includes history and help functions. 

'Nama' is Japanese for 'live', describing live performances,
raw fish and draft beer.
